# [Handcrab Documentation &mdash; Environments](index.html)

## Introduction
A handcrab environment is a marker placed in LaTeX around a specific type of body in order to indicate some kind of pre-conversion or post-conversion process. For example, putting the text `!ROWTABLE!` above `\begin{tabular}{...}` and below `\end{tabular}` indicates that in the conversion to HTML, this table should be made to have row headers.

The main kinds of environments are as follows:

- Table environments (further broken down)
	- Row tables
	- Row/Colum tables
- Image environments
- Long Description Environments

## Table Environments
The table environments are a post-conversion process that changes the header placements of tables. They are done by surrounding the environment with either `!ROWTABLE!` or `!ROWCOLTABLE!` in the LaTeX.

`!ROWTABLE!` will make every cell in the leftmost row into a header, and `!ROWCOLTABLE!` will make every cell in the leftmost row and topmost column into a header.

### Row Table

Consider the following LaTeX

``` {.multiline}
!ROWTABLE!
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
a & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
b & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 \\ \hline
c & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
!ROWTABLE!
```

Running handcrab through a document with this will first strip `\hline` from the table,
and then after converting to HTML, makes each of `a`, `b`, `c` into headers.
Note that since the `\hline` is stripped in the LaTeX, the table generated by pandoc will not have headers.

### Row Col Table

Consider the following LaTeX:

``` {.multiline}
!ROWCOLTABLE!
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
  & a & b & c & d \\ \hline
a & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
b & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\ \hline
c & 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 \\ \hline
d & 4 & 8 & 12 & 16 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
!ROWCOLTABLE!
```


Running handcrab through a document with this will first strip `\hline` from the table,
and then after converting to HTML, makes each of cells with letters into headers.
The top-left empty cell is **not** made into a header.
Since the `\hline` is stripped in the LaTeX, the table generated by pandoc will not have headers.

## Image Environments

The image environments fills the alt text in the HTML with whatever is specified. There are three kinds of image environments, all of which are used in the same way:

- `!ALTMARKER!`
- `!ALTMARKERS!`
- `!NOALT!`

As long as the only text between the `\includegraphics` and the marker is either whitespace, newlines, or nothing, the marker will be associated with the image. Using `!NOALT!` as an example, all four are equivalent:

``` {.multiline}
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{img.png}!NOALT!
```

``` {.multiline}
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{img.png}	!NOALT!
```

``` {.multiline}
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{img.png}
!NOALT!
```

``` {.multiline}
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{img.png}
 
  
	!NOALT!
```

The first two environments, `!ALTMARKER!` and `!ALTMARKERS!` each require text to be on the same line, such as in the following code

``` {.multiline}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{grass.png}
!ALTMARKER! A lovely picture of some grass
```

The text beside the marker will become the alt-text in HTML.

The `!ALTMARKERS!` environment adds the line `class="static"` to the image, which ignores the minimum image size restriction. 

`!NOALT!` is used in the same way as the first two, except does not require alt text, and instead the alt text is left empty upon conversion.



## Long Descriptions

Handcrab automates the creation of long descriptions within LaTeX. This is done by encapsulating everything within the long description by `!LONGDESC!`. The button text is specified at the top, on the same line as the first `!LONGDESC!` in a similar fashion to how alt text is done. An example is provided below.

``` {.multiline}
!LONGDESC! Button text
Sample text
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item 1
	\item 2
	\item 3
\end{enumerate}
!LONGDESC!
```

The long description divs are automatically labelled by ID in order of when they appear.
