<h2>Instructions</h2>
</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(2\frac{1}{2}\)</span> hours</p>
<p><strong>Number of Questions: 10</p> <p>Each question is worth 10 marks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calculating devices are allowed, provided that they do not have any of the following features: (i) internet access, (ii) the ability to communicate with other devices, (iii) information previously stored by students (such as formulas, programs, notes, etc.), (iv) a computer algebra system, (v) dynamic geometry software.</strong></p>
<p> Parts of each question can be of two types:
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>SHORT ANSWER</strong> parts indicated by <img src="../Logos/LightBulb3.png" class = "static" style="height:1cm;" alt="Lightbulb" />
    <ul type = "disc">
      <li>worth 2 or 3 marks each</li>
      <li>full marks are given for a correct answer which is placed in the box</li>
      <li><strong>part marks are awarded if relevant work</strong> is shown in the space provided</li>
    </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>FULL SOLUTION</strong> parts indicated by <img src="../Logos/Writing2.png" class = "static" style="height:1cm;" alt="Full Solution" />
    <ul type = "disc">
      <li>worth the remainder of the 10 marks for the question</li>
      <li>must be written in the appropriate location in the answer booklet</li>
      <li>marks awarded for completeness, clarity, and style of presentation</li>
      <li>a correct solution poorly presented will not earn full marks</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p><strong>WRITE ALL ANSWERS IN THE ANSWER BOOKLET PROVIDED.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Extra paper for your finished solutions supplied by your supervising teacher must beinserted into your answer booklet. Write your name, school name, and question numberon any inserted pages.</li>
  <li>Express answers as simplified exact numbers except where otherwise indicated. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\pi + 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 - \sqrt{2}\)</span> are simplified exact numbers.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<em>Do not discuss the problems or solutions from this contest online for the next 48 hours.</em>
<hr style="border-top: solid 1px black" />
<em>The name, grade, school and location, and score range of some top-scoring students will bepublished on our website, cemc.uwaterloo.ca. In addition, the name, grade, school and location,and score of some top-scoring students may be shared with other mathematical organizationsfor other recognition opportunities.</em>

<div class="infobox">
  NOTE:
  <ol>
    <li>Please read the instructions for the contest.</li>
    <li>Write all answers in the answer booklet provided.</li>
    <li>For questions marked <img src="../Logos/LightBulb3.png" class = "static" style="height:1cm;" alt="Lightbulb" />, place your answer in the appropriate box in the answer booklet and <strong> show your work</strong>.</li>
    <li>For questions marked <img src="../Logos/Writing2.png" class = "static" style="height:1cm;" alt="Full Solution" />, provide a well-organized solution in the answer booklet. Use mathematical statements and words to explain all of the steps of your solution. Work out some details in rough on a separate piece of paper before writing your finished solution.</li>
    <li>Diagrams are <em>not</em> drawn to scale. They are intended as aids only.</li>
    <li>While calculators may be used for numerical calculations, other mathematical steps mustbe shown and justified in your written solutions, and specific marks may be allocated forthese steps. For example, while your calculator might be able to find the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-intercepts of the graph of an equation like <span class="math inline">\(y=x^{3} -x\)</span>, you should show the algebraic steps that you used to find these numbers, rather than simply writing these numbers down.</li>
